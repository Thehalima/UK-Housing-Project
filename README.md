# UK-Housing-Project

### Problem Statement
Rising costs of living in the UK, especially rent is a growing issue for individuals and policymakers. Although inflation is often cited as a key driver of rent increases, this project will explore the relationship between how rent has changed in the UK over the years with the general cost of living related to housing. This analysis looks at the trend, correlation, and geographical comparison between the UK's consumer price index including owner occupier's housing cost (CPIH) and the private housing rental price index from 2010 to 2024.

### Objectives
The project analyzes data from the office for National Statistics (ONS), and its objectives are to answer the following questions;
1. How closely do rental prices follow inflation over time?
2. Are some regions more affected by inflation than others?
3. What do inflation-adjusted rental values have to do with affordability?
4. Forecasting of near-future rent levels based on previous trends.

### Key Insights
1. Both CPIH and the rental index shows a steady upward trend which indicates a general increase in living costs and rent over the years. But. in 2024, rental index dropped a little below CPIH.
2. From 2015 to 2018, the year-on-year change in CPIH and rental index showed a gradual decline, indicating that inflation rate slowed down then. However, from 2021 to 2023, CPIH rose catching up with rental index y-o-y change showing inflation, likely due to global events scuh as the post-pandemic recovery and supply chaininterruptions. But in 2024, CPIH continued to go up, suggesting that the general costs of living kept going up while rental index y-o-y change dropped by about 3% showing a slowdown in rent inflation, possibly due to policies or change in housing demands. This divergence is still climbing, the rental market may be stabilizing or cooling down, at least temporarily.
